    </header>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>What is virtual reality? 
<br><br>
            Virtual reality is a three-dimensional virtual space that the user can interact with by using handheld controllers, allowing the user to enter what is normally seen on a 2d screen, allowing the user to immerse themselves into the worlds created from all kinds of different media or the imagination of others known as computer-generated environments, that are experienced through a pair of goggles and/or gloves giving the illusion that the user is in the space that they are experiencing. Currently, VR is available to buy for anyone, but most of the media on there are games or ways to talk to people all over the world face-to-face, but its potential is almost unlimited as our technology progresses. 
           <br><br> 
            The implications of VR through education can be great, but a lot of drawbacks if used incorrectly. When done right, it can introduce a new world to education, broadening the horizons and modernising ways of teaching in the classrooms to keep students entertained. While this technology is relatively new and doesn’t have a lot of specialisation for schools, the potential of Virtual reality is vast.

    The potential of VR 
    <br> <br>virtual reality has begun to expand from games to work environments this development has shown the potential that VR can have in professional environments such as offices and places of education. Whilst there are some downsides, such as the price of using these in schools to teach, children could make them engage in different ways. When proposed as a game, children are more inclined to want to participate, so using this way of teaching, they can have fun, engage and learn key skills they will need to use later in life. Or they can experience things in new ways, such as historical events that have been recreated and shown as accurately as possible, showing the children the real extent of these important marks in history. This ability to surround the students with what they are learning and keep them engaged with these topics as 65% of the population are visual learners, so this development will mean these people will take in the information better than those who can gain it through listening. It allows people to take part if they aren’t in school as they could be sent a virtual assignment module around the topic that’s been discussed in the module they are doing there are almost endless ways to have this work in the environment. While VR has its positives, there are also potential issues with implementing this into schools one of the main ones is the price as each headset now will roughly be £200 or more, so this will get very pricy very quickly, and with the budgets of schools now it will be virtually impossible to pull off.

     The positves of using VR
    <br><br>
   
Naming a couple of the positives that VR can bring to the table, the big one is that the students can visualise their topics and take part in areas where normally it could be too dangerous for them to do, allowing more interactive activities and opportunities for students to learn. With VR, the interest in learning would be much more engaging as a lot of people find taking notes boring and will lose interest in the topic, so implementing VR allows the students to gain more interest and stay engaged. Students' engagement is around 10 – 15 minutes, so using VR, something that immerses them in the topic will allow them to stay engaged and gain a new understanding of how things work as they experience them first-hand. Another big point is that it doesn’t feel like work a lot of students lose interest as it’s seen as boring work now here, it will make them feel as if it is more a game or experience than learning as the current trope is to learn from reading books and watching educational videos. The detail you can gain from using VR technology is insane as the detail you can go into, for example, the diagram used in a biology class, you can fully see each part of a leaf and how it works in real-time instead of a 2d diagram shown as a still image. Giving a deeper understanding of these types of topics. We have students in every school that come from abroad, some not knowing the language of the country very well, so what VR can do to give them support is by having a translator function whilst they learn the language so they don’t fall behind on work or feel left out when doing group work the same could be said for those who need to communicate to these students having this technology will allow the language barrier to completely vanish. Having the capability of all these things in education would help a lot of people in many ways there, including those with learning disabilities like dyslexia This could help them if they need to read something, the headset could use text to speech and vice versa if the student needed to write something they could talk and the very microphone will pick them up and write what they are saying.

    The negatives of VR 
    <br><br>
        While there are a lot of good aspects of VR, there are always bad to counter-argue there are potential negatives to using VR in education. The students using the headsets could potentially spend a lot of time in VR instead of meeting their fellow students and making connections, leading them to want to stay in VR to talk to real people, get jobs, and create connections down the line, meaning life will be harder than it should be for these individuals. The flexibility of the classes will fade as there is very little that can be changed when in VR, as the things the students will see are predetermined, so the asking of questions and the interactivity in classes will diminish massively, causing some students to completely exclude themselves from the real class. With all technology, there is a good chance that there could be issues with the topics loaded or with the technology itself as with computers, there is a high chance that there could be issues with lag or crashes or the headsets dying during lessons, causing the teacher to have to change the lesson plan on the spot. A major point is if a student has a headset and it has an issue such as it doesn’t charge or it breaks entirely, that student has no way of going over content that was saved on VR and potentially no way to get it back if the headset can’t be fixed. This could be a huge issue when exams come up, and an issue like this could potentially lead the student to fail. The cost of VR headsets, while getting one isn’t that expensive, getting them for hundreds of students adds up very quickly for example, Meta Quest 3 is £469.99, so having that for potentially 1000 students will get very expensive and will have to be maintained over the course of a couple of years meaning there will be even more cost on top of the original price causing the main issue to be cost. There is the issue with the students wanting to be in VR for a very extended period of time, leading to an edition to the virtual world, meaning they wouldn’t want to leave and could potentially be depressed when they don’t have access to the virtual worlds at their fingertips. Following this point, no matter what teachers/lectures try, there will always be students who play games on the computers while in class, and with VR, it can be worse as it is hard to monitor roughly 30 headsets at once as the screens are hidden leading to some people taking advantage and playing games instead of there work.

    Conclusion
  <br>  In conclusion, as much as VR would benefit a lot of people, as of 2024, the technology isn’t dependable enough to be incorporated into the education system, yet the negatives vastly outweigh the positives the cost is the main issue as schools don’t have enough budget to be able to afford these leading them to be a private school only situation where the school is funded by the students attending. The positives are great, but comparing the two, there aren't enough positives to outweigh the cost and the potential influence the headsets could have on the mind of a developing teenager or child, meaning there can be huge issues leading into normal life. In years to come, this could be implemented effectively as the cost of VR decreases and the support for the devices is increased this could have a good effect as there will be more people who have experienced VR and the potential it has in a lot of different aspects of life.  The way VR is going, there is a good chance schools will never incorporate it, as there are aspects that make VR more of a distraction than something that can be used for the student’s good, as they are more seen for gaming and less for educational purposes but that’s only one way it could go. There is a change they bring VR in for some practical purposes such as dissections or something like art where it allows the students to see the finer details and examine them further than they could ever possibly do with the human eye. Finally, as the current technology stands, education could use Virtual reality in education but only in very limited areas for the time being.
